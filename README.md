# Broken Image Display in Dynamic HTML

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in web development: using an invalid image path when dynamically updating HTML content.  The bug results in a broken image, negatively impacting the user experience.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML structure with a div and a button.  Clicking the button updates the div's content, including an image. However, the image path used is invalid, causing the image to fail to load.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version.  It uses a valid image path, ensuring the image is displayed correctly.  Additional error handling could be implemented to gracefully handle cases where the image path is still invalid. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Click the button.
4. Observe the broken image icon.
5. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected version.
